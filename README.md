## Why

*Make your project structure pretty by linting it* üóÇ

Directory structure rules are an important part of any project.
These rules help to raise clarity of the project and reduce its complexity.
Having a clearly defined structure make developers always know where to put files and where to find them.
If the project is big enough, it is necessary to avoid chaos in it.

`folderslint` let you configure directory structure rules and check if existed or new files fit these rules.

## Quick Overview

Install `folderslint` globally:

```sh
pub global activate folderslint
```

or install it as a dev dependency
```sh
pub add dev:folderslint 
```
Setup a config file `.folderslintrc` in the root of the project.

Run `folderslint` to check the whole project or a directory (i.e. `/components`):

(if installed globally)
```sh
folderslint components
```

if installed as a dev dependency

```sh
dart run folderslint components
```

## Configuration
`folderslint` needs configuration file named `.folderslintrc` in the root of the project.

The example of the config:

```json
{
  "root": "src", // optional
  "rules": [
    "components/*",
    "pages/components/*/utils",
    "hooks",
    "legacy/**"
   ]
}
```

`root` is the directory the structure of which should be checked.

`rules` is an array of rules which define permitted directory paths.

### Root directory

You have to specify `root` if you want to check structure in a specific directory. Directories which are out of the `root` will not be checked.
If you want all the directories of the project to be checked, you don't need to specify `root`.

### Rules syntax

There are 3 ways to specify a rule:
- the exact path of a directory,
- `*` instead of a directory name if any directory accepted on that level,
- `**` **at the end of a rule** instead of a directory name if any directory accepted on any lower level. 

‚ö†Ô∏è `**` **can be used only at the end of a rule** because it doesn't make sense to use it at the middle of a rule.
It would make any number of nested directories in the middle of a path accepted
which gives too much flexibility for the idea of clearly defined directory structure rules.

For example:

| Rule                     | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| `components/*/legacy/**` | ‚úÖ&nbsp;&nbsp;The directory `components` is accepted.<br/> ‚úÖ&nbsp;&nbsp;Any *first level* nested directory is accepted.<br/> ‚úÖ&nbsp;&nbsp;The *second level* nested directory `legacy` is accepted.<br/> ‚ùå&nbsp;&nbsp;Any other *second level* nested directory is not accepted.<br/> ‚úÖ&nbsp;&nbsp;Any nested directory on *any level* inside of *legacy* directory is accepted. |

‚ö†Ô∏è A rule like `components/*/utils` automatically make the `components` and `components/*` rules work. So, no need to specify a rule for every level directory. You need to specify the deepest path.

‚ö†Ô∏è It's not recommended to overuse `**` pattern. It lets absence of structure to sprout in your project. Still it could be useful for some directories which have messy structure by its nature - i.e. `node_modules`, not maintained legacy directories.
